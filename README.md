# React shopping cart 

This is my first project using create-react-app during the mentoring studies of the [training-center](https://github.com/training-center) project with the mentor [Cezar Luiz](https://github.com/cezarlz).

## Installing

Install/update packages

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Start project

```sh
$ npm start
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
$ localhost:3000
```

### Sass
```sh
$ npm run watch-css
```
Running npm start and npm run build also builds Sass files.
